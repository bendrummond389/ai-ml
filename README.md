# Machine Learning and AI Study Repo ðŸ¤–

Hey there! This is my study repository as I go through the book "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective." The goal is to understand machine learning and AI algorithms better by coding them up.

## What's Inside ðŸ“¦

- **Notes**: Summaries and key points from each chapter in Markdown format.
- **Distributions**: Code examples of different probability distributions.
  - Written in C++ and maybe some Python.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of ML algorithms like KNN.
  - Primarily in C++ and maybe Python.
- **Models**: Implementations of statistical models like Naive Bayes.
  - Also in C++ and possibly Python.
