# Gaussian Distribution in C++

## Formula
The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is described by the probability density function (PDF):

\[
f(x \;|\; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
\]

- \( \mu \) is the mean
- \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance
- \( x \) is the point at which you're evaluating the function
